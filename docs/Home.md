# Welcome to the RequiForm Wiki

**RequiForm** is a client-side web application for generating and managing test requisition forms. It aims to streamline the process of filling out patient information, selecting specific genetic tests or panels, and producing a final PDF (with embedded QR codes) that can be shared or printed.

This Wiki provides comprehensive documentation for users and contributors.

## Project Goals

- **Security & Privacy**: Keep sensitive patient data strictly within the client environment.  
- **Ease of Use**: Provide a clean, intuitive form-based interface powered by Vue/Vuetify.  
- **Extensibility**: Allow easy updates to the list of genetic tests through a simple JSON file.  
- **Interoperability**: Accept URL parameters so other systems (e.g., EHRs) can link directly into RequiForm with pre-populated data.
